# Jupyter notebooks (JNBs) by Laura Harris
Each zip file comes with at least one JNB and associated example input file(s).

Available JNBs:
1) rowcopy
2) z-score
3) Stouffer's combined p-value
Check out https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.combine_pvalues.html for more information on options and information on Stoufferâ€™s Z-score method to combine p-values
5) Leave one out cross validation (LOOCV)
Check out https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.LeaveOneOut.html for more information on options and information on how this notebook implements LOOCV
6) Receiver operator characteristics (ROC) curve
Check out https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21532099/ for more information on ROC curve use in medical research

New to using JNBs? The Institute for Cyber-Enabled Research (ICER) at Michigan State University can help! In less than an hour, this non-credit, self-paced training workshop introduces you to JNBs and demonstrates how to use notebook features. The workshop provides example notebooks and a project where you create your own notebook, which is reviewed by a real instructor. No prior knowledge is required for this workshop but you must have access to JNB. Links to other free, self-paced training workshops are provided to help you get access to JNBs through installing Anaconda on your personal computer.
