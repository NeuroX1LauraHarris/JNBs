New to Jupyter notebooks? The Institute for Cyber-Enabled Research (ICER) at Michigan State University can help! In less than an hour, this non-credit, self-paced training workshop introduces you to Jupyter notebooks and demonstrates how to use notebook features. The workshop provides example notebooks and a project where you create your own notebook, which is reviewed by a real instructor. No prior knowledge is required for this workshop but you must have access to Jupyter Notebook. Links to other free, self-paced training workshops are provided to help you get access to Jupyter Notebook through installing Anaconda on your personal computer.
